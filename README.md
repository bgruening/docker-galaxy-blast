Installed tools

Usage
=====

At first you need to install docker. Please follow the instruction on https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation

After the successful installation, all what you need to do is:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-exom-seq
```

I will shortly explain the meaning of all the parameters. For a more detailed describtion please consult the [docker manual](http://docs.docker.io/), it's really worth reading.

Let's start: ``docker run`` will run the Image/Container for you. In case you do not have the Container stored locally, docker will download it for you. ``-p 8080:80`` will make the port 80 (inside of the container) available on port 8080 on your host. Inside the container a Apache Webserver is running on port 80 and that port can be bound to a local port on your host computer. With this parameter you can access your Galaxy instance via ``http://localhost:8080`` immediately after executing the command above. ``bgruening/galaxy-exom-seq`` is the Image/Container name, that directs docker to the correct path in the [docker index](https://index.docker.io/u/bgruening/galaxy-stable/). ``-d`` will start the docker container in daemon mode. For an interactive session, you can execute:

```bash
docker run -i -t -p 8080:80 bgruening/galaxy-exom-seq
```

and run the ``` startup ``` script by your own, to start PostgreSQL, Apache and Galaxy.

Docker images are "read-only", all your changes inside one session will be lost after restart. This mode is usefull to present Galaxy to your collegues or to run workshops with it. To install Tool Shed respositories or to save your data you need to export the calculated data to the host computer.

Fortunately, this is as easy as:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/ bgruening/galaxy-exom-seq
```

With the additional ``-v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/`` parameter, docker will mount the folder ``/home/user/galaxy_storage`` into the Container under ``/export/``. A ``startup.sh`` script, that is usually starting Apache, PostgreSQL and Galaxy, will recognise the export directory with one of the following outcomes:

  - In case of an empty ``/export/`` directory, it will move the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, the Galaxy database directory, Shed Tools and Tool Dependencies and various config scripts to /export/ and symlink back to the original location.
  - In case of a non-empty ``/export/``, for example if you continue a previouse session within the same folder, nothing will be moved, but the symlinks will be created.

This enables you to have different export folders for different sessions - means real separation of your different projects.


Users & Passwords
================

The Galaxy Admin User has the username ``admin@galaxy.org`` and the password ``admin``.
The PostgreSQL username is ``galaxy``, the password is ``galaxy`` and the database name is ``galaxy`` (I know I was really creative ;)).
If you want to create new users, please make sure to use the ``/export/`` volume. Otherwise your user will be removed after your docker session is finished.
